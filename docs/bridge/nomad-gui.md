# Nomad Bridge GUI

## Bridging Through Nomad

Bridging assets across chains using Nomad should be intuitive and easy with the Nomad GUI. In this tutorial, we will walk through the steps required to bridge your assets.

Please find our production bridge GUI at [app.nomad.xyz](https://app.nomad.xyz/).

If you would like to test our bridge using testnet funds before using real funds, please visit our development GUI at [development.app.nomad.xyz](https://development.app.nomad.xyz/).

Click `Bridge Tokens` and approve the transaction in Metamask:

<br>

After approving the transaction, you will be taken to the transaction details page. Here, you will see the estimated time remaining for your transfer to complete:

<br>

You can expand the time estimate tab to track your transaction status:

Eventually you should see this display when your transfer has completed. When you do see this display, your funds will be in the account of the destination address. If your transfer is taking longer than expected, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/RurtmJApqm) in the #support channel:
