# Cross-Chain Governance

## Pre-Requisite Reading

- [Nomad: Optimistic Interchain Communication](../index.md)

## Summary

### Purpose

This document describes **a governable system for executing permissioned actions across chains**.

We aim to clearly describe

- **what** contracts comprise the system for calling permissioned functions across chains
- **which** functions will be delegated to this system at launch, and
- (directionally) **who** will have permission to call these functions at launch and in the future

### Out of Scope

This document does NOT describe a system for **how** governance actions will be proposed, voted on, and/or approved before being executed.

It does not describe how contract upgrades will be written, reviewed, verified.

### Overview

We define a role, `governor`, with the power to perform permissioned actions across chains. In order to empower the `governor`, we deploy a cross-chain application comprised of a `GovernanceRouter` contract on each chain.

Each `GovernanceRouter` can be delegated control over an arbitrary set of permissioned functions on its local chain. The only way to access the permissioned functionality is to call the function via the `GovernanceRouter` contract.

Each `GovernanceRouter` is programmed to accept messages ***only*** from the `governor`, which is deployed on only one chain. The `governor` may call the contract locally (if it is deployed on the same chain), or it may send it messages remotely via Nomad. Because of its exclusive power over the `GovernanceRouter` contracts, the `governor` has exclusive rights to perform **all** of the permissioned roles that are delegated to the `GovernanceRouter` on each chain.

The system receives orders from the `governor` and carries out their effects across chains; it is agnostic to how the `governor` chooses to operate. This maintains flexibility to design the governance proposal process in the future.

At launch, the core functionality that will be delegated to the `GovernanceRouter` on each chain is  the power to upgrade the implementation of the `Home` and `Replica` contracts. This way, the `governor` will have the power to conduct upgrades of the Nomad system on every chain. More details on the upgradability system can be found [here](./upgrade-setup.md).

At launch, the `governor` will be a multisig of trusted team and community members. In the near future, the `governor` role will most likely be transferred to a more fully-featured set of contracts capable of accepting proposals, tallying votes, and executing successful proposals.

## Message Flow Diagram

![Cross-chain Governance Diagram](/governance-diagram.png)

1. `governor` sends message to its local `GovernanceRouter`
2. `GovernanceRouter` dispatches the message...
    1. if the recipient is local, to the recipient directly (→ process finished)
    2. if the recipient is remote, via Nomad to the local Home contract (→ continue to 3)
3. Message is relayed from local `Home` to remote `Replica` via Nomad
4. `Replica` dispatches message to the remote `GovernanceRouter`
5. `GovernanceRouter` dispatched the message directly to the local recipient

**Note on message recipient:**

- the recipient may be a `Replica` or `Home` contract
- it may be an `UpgradeBeacon` that controls the implementation of `Replica` or `Home`
- it may be any other app

For simplicity & clarity to show the message flow, this diagram represents the recipient as a generic "App"

## Specification

### Glossary of Terms

- **xApp** - Cross-Chain Application
- **role** —
  - an address stored in a smart contract's state that specifies an entity with special permissions on the contract
  - permission to call certain functions is usually implemented using a function modifier that requires that the caller of the function is one of the roles with permission to call it; all contract calls sent from callers that do not have valid permission will revert
  - *example*: `owner` is the **role** set on all [Ownable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol) contracts upon deployment; the `owner` **role** has exclusive permission to call functions with the `onlyOwner` modifier
- **permissioned function** —
  - any smart contract function that restricts callers of the function to a certain role or roles
  - *example*: functions using the `onlyOwner` modifier on [Ownable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/access/Ownable.sol) contracts
- **permissioned call** — a call to a **permissioned function**
- **governor chain** —
  - the chain on which the `governor` is deployed
  - the chain whose `GovernanceRouter` is also the special `GovernorRouter` which can *send* messages; all `GovernanceRouters`  on other chains can only *receive* governance messages

### On-Chain Components

#### **GovernanceRouter**

- xApp designed to perform permissioned roles on core Nomad contracts on all chains
- State Variables
- **governor** state variable
  - if the `governor` is local, `governor` will be set to the EVM address of the `governor`
  - if the `governor` is remote, `governor` will be `address(0)`
- **governorDomain** state variable
  - the Nomad domain of the **governor chain**
  - stored as a state variable on all `GovernanceRouters`; should be the same on all `GovernanceRouters`; always non-zero
    - if the `governor` is local, `governorDomain` is equal to the `originDomain` of the local `Home` contract
    - if the `governor` is remote, `governorDomain` is equal to the `originDomain` of the remote `Home` contract
  - equal to the `originDomain` of the local `Home` contract on the chain of the `GovernorRouter`
  - used by all `GovernanceRouters` to determine whether an incoming Nomad message was sent from the `GovernorRouter`
    - if the message is from the `GovernorRouter`, the `GovernanceRouter` will handle the incoming message
    - if not, it will revert
- **routers** state variable
  - a mapping of domain → address of the remote `GovernanceRouter` on every other chain
- **domains** state variable
  - an array of all domains that are registered in `routers`
  - used to loop through and message all other chains when taking governance actions
  - there is the possibility that some domains in the array are null (if a chain has been de-registered)
- **GovernorRouter**
  - the special `GovernanceRouter` that has *permission to send* governance messages to all other `GovernanceRouters`
  - the `GovernanceRouter` on the **governor chain**

#### **Governor**

- via the `GovernanceRouter` system, it has the unique ability to call permissioned  functions on **any contract** on **any chain** that transfers permission to the local `GovernanceRouter`
- the **role** with permission to send messages to the `GovernorRouter`
  - the `GovernorRouter` has exclusive permission to send messages via Nomad to all other `GovernanceRouters`
  - the `GovernanceRouters` can have arbitrary permissions delegated to them by any contract on their local chain
  - therefore, the `governor` is the entity with the power to call any **permissioned function** delegated to any `GovernanceRouter` on any chain
- there is only one `governor` throughout the Nomad system; it can be deployed on any chain
- the `governor` role can always be transferred to another contract, on the same chain **or** a different remote chain
- stored as a state variable on `GovernanceRouters`; set to zero on all `GovernanceRouters` except on the **governor chain**
- **Any contract** on **any chain** that wishes for this governance system to have discretion to call a set of its functions can create a role & a function modifier giving exclusive permission to that role to call the function(s) (similar pattern to Ownable). The contract must then set the local `GovernanceRouter` to the permissioned role, which — by extension — gives the `governor` exclusive permission to call those functions (regardless of whether the `governor` is remote or local)

### Failure States

If there is fraud on the Nomad `Home` contract on the **governor chain**, this is currently a "catastrophic failure state" — no further governance actions can be rolled out to remote chains; we must create a plan to recover the system in this case.

## Message Types

### Executing (Arbitrary) Calls

1. **for each chain**, the `governor` constructs the array of `(to, data)` calls to the permissioned functions on the contracts that will perform the upgrades on that chain
2. the `governor` sends a transaction to the `GovernanceRouter.callRemote` function on its local the , passing in the `domain` of the remote chain and the array of `(to, data)` calls of transactions to execute on that chain
3. the local `GovernanceRouter` constructs an Nomad-compatible message from the array of calls, addresses the message to the remote `GovernanceRouter`, and sends the message to the local `Home` contract 
4. the message is relayed from the local `Home` to the remote `Replica` contract on the specified `domain`
5. the `Replica` dispatches the message to the specified recipient, which is the local `GovernanceRouter`
6. the `GovernanceRouter` parses the message to decode the array of `(to, data)` calls 
7. the `GovernanceRouter` uses low-level call to execute each of the transactions in the array within the local chain

### **Transferring Governor**

#### **Possible State Transitions**

1. called by the local owner to transfer ownership to another local owner (`domain` does not change, `owner` changes to a new `bytes32` address)
2. called by the local owner to transfer ownership to a remote owner (`domain` changes to the remote, `owner` changes from a non-zero `bytes32` to `bytes32(0)`)
3. called by a remote owner to transfer ownership to a local owner (`domain` changes to the local domain, `owner` changes from `bytes32(0)` to a non-zero `bytes32`)
4. called by a remote owner to transfer ownership to another remote owner (`domain` changes to the new remote owner, `owner` remains `bytes32(0)`)

### Enrolling a Router

- used when a new chain is added to Nomad after we've already set up the system and transferred governorship
- add a new domain → address mapping to the `routers` mapping on every other `GovernanceRouter`

## Functionality at Launch

### Permissioned Roles

At launch, the `GovernanceRouter` system **will have the following permissions**:

1. upgrade the implementation of `Home` (via `UpgradeBeacon` pattern)
2. upgrade the implementation of all `Replicas` (via 1-to-N `UpgradeBeacon` pattern)
3. upgrade the implementation of itself (via `UpgradeBeacon` pattern)

The `GovernanceRouter` **will NOT have permission** to:

- un-enroll a `Replica` from the `UsingNomad` contract, which will require a specialized role that can act quickly

### Governor

The flexibility of this system will support a move to progressive decentralization.

Initially, the `governor` will most likely be a multisig controlled by trusted team and community members

Later, the `governor` role will most likely be transferred to a decentralized governance contract
