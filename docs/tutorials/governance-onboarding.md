# Governance Signer Onboarding 

We are so excited to introduce Nomad's novel cross-chain governance system to the inaugural Nomad Community. As a decentralized interoperability protocol with connections to a growing set of new and established blockchain networks, the Nomad Core Team's goal is to establish a progressive shared ownership with as many stakeholders as possible. 

If you are here and reading this, chances are you have been asked to be a Governance key-holder. Congratulations and thank you in advance for your service! 

At a high level, there are several steps you must complete in order to be fully enrolled and established publicly as a key-holder: 

- Generate a new address on a hardware wallet
- Sign a message with your newly-generated address
- Share your address, message signature, and contact information with the Nomad Core Team
- Share your message signature with the community via a public channel

## Generate an Address

Depending on your hardware wallet, the steps could be slightly different. Here's some quick links for various common wallets: 
- Ledger: [Add Your Accounts](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/articles/4404389482641-Add-your-accounts?docs=true)
- Trezor: [User Guide](https://wiki.trezor.io/User_manual)

## Sign a Message

Next, in order to signal your ownership and control over your Governance Signer, we're asking all key-holders to sign their choice from a list of provided messages and share it with the community for manual verification. 

### Message Options

You are free to choose your favorite Nomad-related message from the below list. Nothing here suit your fancy? Reach out to your Point of Contact on the Nomad Core Team and we'd be happy to facilitate the use of a personalized message. 

- I am a #MadLad!
- I am a #MadLass! 
- u #mad?

### Signing with MyCrypto.com

There are many options when it comes to ways of signing messages with your hardware wallet, we recommend using MyCrypto.com for ease of use. 

The direct link to the Message Sign tool is [here](https://app.mycrypto.com/sign-message).

**Steps:**

1. Connect a wallet to the MyCrypto UI
    
NOTE: The direct ledger integration on MyCrypto.com's Message Signature tool is outdated, we recommend using the Metamask + Hardware Wallet integration. 

Select a wallet:

Connect to Metamask:

2. Sign Message 

Now that your wallet is connected, we can use the MyCrypto UI to sign your choice of message from the above options. 

![Sign a Message](../tutorials/governance-signer/sign-message.png)

Approve the signature in Metamask:

Approve the Signature on your Device:

Nice! You should now have a successful signature output in the MyCrypto UI: 

![Signature Success](../tutorials/governance-signer/signature-success.png)

Here's what the output of your signature should look like: 

```json
{
  "address": "<ADDRESS>",
  "msg": "I am a #MadLad!",
  "sig": "<SIGNATURE>",
  "version": "2"
}
```

## Share with the Nomad Core Team

Great! You've signed the message with your new governance signer key, now it's time to share this data with the Nomad Core Team. We will be publishing all of the signatures as well as information that identifies each signer in order to bolster confidence that the Nomad protocol governance is in good hands. 

We request the following information: 
- Twitter Handle
- Telegram Handle
- Governance Signer Address
- Raw Message Signature output from MyCrypto.com

Please email this information to [gm@nomad.xyz](mailto:gm@nomad.xyz).

## Greet the #MadLad Community!

Now for the fun part! Share your message and signature with the Nomad Community via an established public channel that you control. We have a strong preference for Twitter, as the crypto community almost exclusively lives there. 

If you don't have Twitter, or have an alternative channel you would like to publish on, please discuss that with your Point of Contact on the Nomad Core Team and we'd be happy to work with you.
