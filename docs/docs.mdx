_Welcome!_ Youâ€™ve arrived at Nomad's documentation.

Nomad is a novel approach to blockchain interoperability that leverages an optimistic mechanism to increase the security of cross-chain communication. Using Nomad, developers can securely build cross-chain applications (or xApps) and bridge assets between chains. Nomad channels and the flagship xApp, the Nomad token bridge, are live on Ethereum and Moonbeam, with more chains coming soon.
